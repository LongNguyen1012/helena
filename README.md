# Helena Web Automation and Web Scraping

#### What is Helena?
Helena is a Chrome extension that can help automate repetitive interactions with well-structured webpages.  A user can demonstrate how to scrape the first row of a dataset, and Helena will write a program for scraping the next hundreds or thousands of rows.  Helena is also the name of the web automation language that the Helena extension uses.

#### How do I install Helena?
First, get a copy of this repository.  If you've never cloned a repository before, just find the "Clone or download" button and choose the "Download ZIP" option.  Next follow the directions for loading an unpacked extension here: https://developer.chrome.com/extensions/getstarted#unpacked.  The directory to load is the `src` directory from the Helena repository you cloned or downloaded.

#### Can I get Helena from the Chrome Web Store?
We have not yet released a 'packed' version of Helena, since it's still in the early stages and still undergoing many substantial changes.  We do expect to release a version in the Chrome Web Store eventually.

#### Will Helena work on my computer?
Helena has been tested with recent versions of Chrome on recent Mac and Linux operating systems.

#### How should I learn to use Helena?
We recommend learning from video tutorials!  Our current playlist of tutorials is available here: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYeneIW6KQxIDUEp2QaNNKrgXg9hVvxZo

We recommend starting with something simple like our favorite Google Scholar example!

Once you've watched a few video tutorials and you're almost ready to start writing your own scripts, we highly recommend checking out our tips and tricks page: https://github.com/schasins/helena/wiki/Tips-and-Tricks.

#### Is Helena reliable?
Helena is just a research prototype.  It's being developed by only one person, and it's still quite new.  So definitely don't expect it to be a reliable, professional-quality, production-ready tool.  But if you run into problems, please get in touch - we want to keep making it better!

#### May I use Helena for my project?
We designed Helena to help researchers, especially social scientists and data scientists.  If you're looking to use Helena for those purposes, please go ahead!

#### Are you looking for collaborators?
Yes!  If you're interested in either using Helena for your research or in helping to improve Helena, please get in touch!
