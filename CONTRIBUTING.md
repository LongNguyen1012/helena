# How to contribute

We're so happy you're interested in getting involved!
Since this is still a research prototype, there's always lots to do!
We're still fleshing out these guidelines, but here are the basics.

## Community stuff

Be nice.  Seriously.

## Submitting changes

Please send GitHub pull requests with clear lists of what you've done.  
(Read more about pull requests at [http://help.github.com/pull-requests/].)
Also please make sure you implement only one feature per commit and that you associate a clear log message with each commit.
Feel free to provide one-line messages for small changes, but bigger changes should look like this:

    $ git commit -m "The one-line summary of changes
    > 
    > A paragraph describing exactly what changed, the goals, and the impact."
