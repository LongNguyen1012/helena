This page discusses how we can use the Chrome extension to do things like editing, saving, and running Helena programs.

<div class="tutorial-item" id="saveProgram">
<div class="tutorial-item-title">Saving Programs</div>
To save a Helena program, just give it a name and press the "Save" button.

</div>

<div class="tutorial-item" id="retrieveSavedProgram">
<div class="tutorial-item-title">Retrieving Saved Programs</div>
To load a saved Helena program, click on the "Saved Scripts" tab in the control pane.  Either browse through the list of saved programs or, if you remember the name of the program you're seeking, use Chrome's usual CTRL+F search functionality to search for the name of the program you want.  Once you've found the program, click on it, and the extension will load the saved program.  Now you can edit or run the program as usual.

<div class="tutorial-item" id="checkTable">
<div class="tutorial-item-title">Checking Relevant Tables</div>
When you record a demonstration, Helena looks for tables of data on the pages with which you interact.  Sometimes you may want to check and make sure Helena is extracting the right data.  To take a look at the tables Helena found, scroll down in the "Current Script" tab and click on the "Relevant Tables" item.  You can take a look at all the tables Helena extracted, rename the tables (or the columns), and see a preview of the first three rows of data.

</div>

<div class="tutorial-item" id="previewTable">
<div class="tutorial-item-title">Previewing Relevant Tables in Webpages</div>
You want to be sure that the tables Helena finds are getting all the data you expect, and sometimes the best way to check is to look at the page and see which nodes Helena finds and which it doesn't.  If this is what you want to do, scroll down in the "Current Script" tab and click on the "Relevant Tables" item.  Find the preview of the table you want to see in its own page, then scroll down to the "Edit This Table" button for that table.  Click on "Edit This Table," and Helena will open the page that shows the table.  If you need to interact with the page to get the table to show, go ahead and do that.  Once the table is visible, click the "Page Shows My Table" button.  Helena will show the extracted data in the control pane, and it will highlight the extracted nodes in the webpage.  This can be especially useful for cases, like the one demonstrated in the GIF below, in which we're scraping images.

<div class="tutorial-item" id="editTable">
<div class="tutorial-item-title">Editing Tables</div>
If Helena didn't get quite the right table, you can also edit a table.  Start by following the directions for <a href="#previewTable">Previewing Relevant Tables in Webpages</a>.  The user interface for editing tables is still very much in flux, but there are a few things you can do from the current interface version.  In particular, a common task is to indicate how to reach more pages of a table.  For example, if you scroll to find more rows of the table, you'd click on "Scroll for More" (see GIF below).  If you find more rows with a next button, you'd click on "Next Button" and then follow the directions to click on the next button in the actual webpage.  If you find more rows with a more button, you'd click on "More Button" and do the same process.
